## Title: Building Robust Applications with SOLID Principles in C#

# Introduction:

In the ever-evolving world of software development, creating robust and maintainable code is crucial.
One approach that has gained widespread acceptance is the adoption of SOLID principles.
These principles, introduced by Robert C. Martin, provide a set of guidelines that empower developers to build scalable, flexible, and maintainable applications.
In this article, we'll explore each of the SOLID principles in the context of C#, discuss the issues they address, and provide insights into how developers can apply
them to deliver robust applications.

# What does SOLID stand for:
SOLID is an acronym for the five design namely:
S => Single Responsibility Principle,
O => Open/Closed Principle,
L => Liskov Substitution Principle,
I => Interface Segregation Principle and
D => Dependency Inversion Principle. 

Applying these time proven principles make your code structured, neat and easy to maintain.

# What are the priciples about
# Single Responsibility Principle
The Single Responsibility Principle states that "Each software module or a class should have only one reason to change", meaning it should have only one responsibility.

By adhering to SRP, developers can create more focused and modular classes, resulting in code that is easier to understand and maintain.

In C#, this principle encourages developers to break down complex classes into smaller ones, each responsible for a specific task.
For example, if a class handles both data storage and user interface interactions, splitting it into separate classes for data access and user interface can enhance clarity and maintainability.
