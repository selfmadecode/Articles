## Title: Building Robust Applications with SOLID Principles in C#

# Introduction:

In the ever-evolving world of software development, creating robust and maintainable code is crucial.
One approach that has gained widespread acceptance is the adoption of SOLID principles.
These principles, introduced by Robert C. Martin, provide a set of guidelines that empower developers to build scalable, flexible, and maintainable applications.
In this article, we'll explore each of the SOLID principles in the context of C#, discuss the issues they address, and provide insights into how developers can apply
them to deliver robust applications.

# What does SOLID standd for:
SOLID is an acronym for the five design namel
Single Responsibility Principle,
Open/Closed Principle,
Liskov Substitution Principle,
Interface Segregation Principle and
Dependency Inversion Principle. 

Applying these time proven principles make your code structured, neat and easy to maintain.
