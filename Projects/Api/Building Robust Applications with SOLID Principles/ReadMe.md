## Title: Building Robust Applications with SOLID Principles in C#

Introduction:

In the ever-evolving world of software development, creating robust and maintainable code is crucial.
One approach that has gained widespread acceptance is the adoption of SOLID principles.
These principles, introduced by Robert C. Martin, provide a set of guidelines that empower developers to build scalable, flexible, and maintainable applications.
In this article, we'll explore each of the SOLID principles in the context of C#, discuss the issues they address, and provide insights into how developers can apply
them to deliver robust applications.
